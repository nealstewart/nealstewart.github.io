    <h2>Working</h2>
    <p>
        Splitting into functions rather than classes seems to make it much easier both to decompose, compose, and
        to reconstitute (remove a function and inline it back into its parent).
    </p>

    <p>
        Is there a better word for that?
    </p>

    <h3>Generative tests</h3>
    <p>
        Using the computer to brute force test cases seems very efficient. It obfuscates exact test cases, and does
        seem likely to create some stupid test cases. But it works. It encourages thinking in terms of sets of cases,
        rather than individual cases.
    </p>

    <h3>Reading the manual</h3>
    <p>
        Today I spent some time doing generative tests and feeling clever when, in fact, I could have just read the
        documention on D3's ticks in order to discover that they automatically provide tick precision calculations.
        I should consider looking a bit more into D3, to save some time on that.
    </p>

    <p>
        I should try and learn a new feature of each of my tools each day.

    <p>
        D3 provides a library with a number of interesting functions for timing animations from JavaScript. This could be
        interesting when performing visualisations that don't allow you to use CSS very easily for animation, such as
        when dimensions are dynamic and based on scaled data values.
